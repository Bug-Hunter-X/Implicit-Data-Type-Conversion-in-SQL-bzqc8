The SQL query uses a function that implicitly converts a string to a number. This can lead to unexpected results if the string cannot be converted or if the conversion does not match the expected data type. For example, the function `TO_NUMBER` or `CAST` in Oracle can throw an error if the string is not a valid number. Similarly, implicit conversion in other databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL can lead to unexpected values or exceptions.
