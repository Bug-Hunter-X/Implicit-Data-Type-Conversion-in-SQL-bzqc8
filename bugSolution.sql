The solution involves using explicit type casting or conversion functions to avoid implicit conversions. This can prevent unexpected results and errors.  For instance, instead of relying on implicit conversion, explicitly convert the string column using a function like `CAST` or `CONVERT` before using it in numerical operations. The specific function will depend on the database system being used.  Always validate inputs and handle potential errors gracefully.
